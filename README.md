# droidgammon

Please note this is a quick and dirty Android port of my backgammon game ( original is here https://github.com/amiga/portablebackgammon ) - the project is an IntelliJ Android one. I whipped this up in 2011 based on the original desktop Java version I made. I haven't touched it for a while, and may need some redunant (commented out) code to be removed in androidspecifics/ but it did work back in the day. If you fix any issues please feel free to push changes. 

Also if anyone gets it going in say Android Studio, it would be good to get a repos up of that too.

Note the code in androidspecifics/ is for the android platform, the other code in gamelogic/ and lowlevel/ is pure java and not platform specific. Enjoy.
