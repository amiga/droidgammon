# droidgammon

Please note this is an Android port of my backgammon game ( original is here https://github.com/amiga/portablebackgammon ) - the project is an IntelliJ Android one. I whipped this up in 2011 based on the original desktop Java version I made. I haven't touched it for a while, but it did work back in the day. If you fix any issues please feel free to push changes. 

Also if anyone gets it going in say Android Studio, it would be good to get a repos up of that too.
